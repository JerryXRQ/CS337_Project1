Golden Globe Project Master
The following packages are required to run our code:
numpy
nltk
pandas
spacy==2.3.5
bs4
bing_image_downloader
textblob
vaderSentiment

For spacy, we need to install en_core_web_sm via python -m spacy download en.
For nltk, we need to add the names files with command python -m nltk.downloader names
For textblob, we need to download necessary data by running python -m textblob.download_corpora

Apart from spacy and its data, the version of other packages does not affect the result.
